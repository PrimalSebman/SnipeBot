/snipe quote - Sniper quote for fun
/snipe register - Get the Sniper role and get an entry on the "leaderboard" (Firebase)
/snipe target (@ user)- Snipe someone else
/snipe leaderboard - See leaderboard of Snipers
/snipe achievement list - See all achievements
/snipe achievement request (str name)- Manually request an achievement
/snipe achievement grant (@ user, str name) - Only for Snipemins, give someone an achievement
/snipe achievment personal - See achievements you've gotten

Figure out a way to write to a JSON file everyone who's registered
Then, update the Firebase so that there's a new entry for the person who registered
I'd say let's keep track of Snipes, Points, Times Sniped, and a list of Achievements gained

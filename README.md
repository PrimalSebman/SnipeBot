### Setup Requirements
* Your Server will need a role called **Sniper**
  * Permissions don't matter, as long as the bot is above it and can manage that role
* Bot uses the following permissions
  * `Manage Roles` - This is used to handle interactions with the Sniper role, which is how the Bot handles tracking of Snipes
  * `Send Messages` - To display information about Snipes to server members
  * `Use Slash Commands` - This is how the Bot receives commands to execute
  * `Embed Links` - To display the leaderboards and Achievement information
  * `Add Reactions` - Currently doesn't do this, but may be an avenue for development later

## Commands
- `/snipe register` - Register yourself as a Sniper and get on the database.
- `/snipe target` - Snipe another user(s) in your Server!

# Contact/Feedback
This has been my first major project on my own! It's in a state that I enjoy right now, but I'm open to any feedback or suggestions to improve or expand the Bot!
